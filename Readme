To run the website, create a localhost file using XAMPP and put all the data in the htdocs folder.
Add the code in the path of the XAMPP servers so they can run python files. 
Give permission to every python file so it can be run. (chmod 755)
Download XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Open the XAMPP folder of the downloaded and installed program and replace the files in the folder with those in the repository. 
Run using localhost on the same machine or check the IP using ifconfig and share the IP over the Localnetwork to use on other machines.
